# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🌟 Overview

Hey there, developer! We know security is usually a big deal, but with the Autonomy Software project, things are a little different. Since it’s an **offline application** and doesn’t handle sensitive data, security isn’t our main concern. That said, we still care about building solid and reliable software—so keep reading for how you can help us improve!

## 💪 Best Practices

Even though security isn’t our focus, good coding practices are always in style. Here are a few tips to keep everything running smoothly:

- 🔄 **Keep dependencies up to date** – Fresh is best!
- 👀 **Conduct regular code reviews** – More eyes, fewer bugs.
- 🧪 **Test, test, and test again** – Make sure everything works like a charm before deployment.

## 🎯 Scope

This policy covers the code in this repository and any dependencies we’re using. It’s all about making sure our offline software stays robust and reliable.
