## üêõ Reporting Bugs

### üîç Before Submitting a Bug Report

To help us fix potential bugs quickly, please ensure the following:

- **Use the latest version** of the software.
- **Verify** that the issue is a bug and not an error on your side (e.g., incompatible environment components/versions). Check the [documentation](https://missourimrdt.github.io/Autonomy_Software/) for guidance.
- **Search** the [bug tracker](https://github.com/MissouriMRDT/Autonomy_Software/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported or solved.
- **Collect relevant information** such as:
  - Backtrace (if applicable)
  - OS, Platform, and Version
  - Steps to reliably reproduce the issue

### ‚úçÔ∏è Submitting a Good Bug Report

To submit a bug report:

1. **Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/MissouriMRDT/Autonomy_Software/issues/new)** on GitHub.
2. **Describe the expected behavior** and **the actual behavior**.
3. **Provide detailed reproduction steps**, including code snippets where possible.
4. **Include any gathered information** (backtrace, OS, platform, version).

Good bug reports help us isolate the problem faster and improve the software more efficiently.

## üí° Suggesting Enhancements

### üîç Before Submitting an Enhancement Suggestion

- **Ensure you are using the latest version** of the software.
- **Check the [documentation](https://missourimrdt.github.io/Autonomy_Software/)** to see if the feature already exists.
- **Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MissouriMRDT/Autonomy_Software/issues)** to see if someone has already suggested a similar enhancement.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Submitting a Good Enhancement Suggestion

To submit an enhancement suggestion:

1. **Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/MissouriMRDT/Autonomy_Software/issues)** on GitHub.
2. **Use a clear, descriptive title**.
3. **Provide a step-by-step description** of your suggested enhancement.
4. **Explain the current behavior** and **describe the expected behavior**, including why the change is beneficial.

## üíæ Commit Messages

### Guidelines

- Keep commit messages under **50 characters**.
- Always include a reference to the relevant issue number in the format: `#<issue num>`.

Example:
```
fix: Resolve crash in navigation state machine #42
```

---

## üîÑ Pull Requests

### Guidelines

- Keep pull request titles under **50 characters**.
- Include a detailed description of the changes made.
- Use `closed #<issue num>` in the description to link the pull request to a specific issue.

Example:
```
Closed #42: Fixed crash in the navigation state machine by adjusting state transitions.
```

### Automatic Review Assignment

Once a pull request is opened, it will be automatically assigned to a member of the [software review](https://github.com/orgs/MissouriMRDT/teams/software-review) team for review. This ensures that every contribution receives prompt feedback and aligns with the project guidelines.

## üõë Marking Issues in Code

To mark sections of code for later review, we use keywords that can be compiled into a to-do list in the TODO extension tab. Here's a list of commonly used keywords:

- `// * @todo` or `// @todo` ‚Äì Marks sections of code for future implementation.
- `// TODO:` ‚Äì Generic to-do items.
- `// BUG:` ‚Äì Known issues or bugs.
- `// HACK:` ‚Äì Temporary workarounds that need improvement.
- `// FIXME:` ‚Äì Sections of code that are broken and need fixing.
- `// LEAD:` ‚Äì Important notes for review by team leads.
- `// ISSUE NOTE:` ‚Äì Problematic code that needs attention.
- `// TEST:` ‚Äì Indicates areas that require testing.

You can also use checklist-style comments:
- `// [ ]` ‚Äì Unchecked to-do item.
- `// [x]` ‚Äì Checked to-do item.

### üî† Macro Names

Macros should be in all caps using underscores to separate words. They should be detailed enough to not require an additional comment.

Example:
```c
#define ARUCO_DEBUG_PRINTS false
#define AUTONOMY_MAJOR_VERSION 24
```

---

### üìê Function Names

Functions should use PascalCase for names. Use detailed names and include a Doxygen comment.

Example:
```cpp
/* Type: `/**` and then <enter> to start doxygen comment block */
void InitializeSensor();
```

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Class and Struct Names

Classes and structs should use PascalCase for names. Use short, descriptive names, and include a Doxygen comment.

Example for a class:

```cpp
/* Type: `/**` and then <enter> to start doxygen comment block */
class SensorManager {
  // class implementation
};
