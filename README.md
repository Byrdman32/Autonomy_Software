## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Before diving into the installation, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

To build and run the Autonomy Software, you can either set up the necessary dependencies manually on your local system or use our pre-configured Docker environment where everything is preinstalled.

#### Option 1: Using the Preinstalled Docker Environment (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is by using our Docker environment. This environment comes with all the required software and dependencies preinstalled, including:

- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 12.2**
- **CMake 3.30.2**
- **GCC 10**
- **OpenCV 4.10.0**
- **PyTorch 2.2.2**
- **TensorFlow 2.15.0**
- **ZED SDK 4.1**
- **Quill 7.0.0-pre**
- **Google Test 1.15.2**
- **Abseil 20230802.1**
- **GeographicLib 2.3**
- **Git LFS**
- **And more...**

This Docker environment is designed to work seamlessly with NVIDIA GPUs and supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

#### Option 2: Setting Up Manually on Your Local System

If you prefer to set up the environment manually, make sure your system has the following hardware and software dependencies installed:

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - NVIDIA Graphics Card with CUDA support (required for running GPU-accelerated vision processing)
  - Minimum CUDA version: 12.2 (compatible with the NVIDIA graphics card for GPU computation)
  - NVIDIA Jetson Devices (JetPack SDK required for ARM64 platforms)

- **Operating Systems**:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 or higher (for AMD64 platforms)
  - NVIDIA Jetson Devices with JetPack SDK (required for ARM64 platforms)

- **Required Software**:
  - CMake 3.24.3 or higher
  - GCC 10 or higher (for compiling C++ code)
  - Git 2.25 or higher
  - Git LFS (Large File Storage) 2.13.0 or higher (for handling large files)
  - Python 3.8 or higher (for scripting and utility purposes)
  - Doxygen (for generating documentation)
  - OpenCV 4.10.0 or higher (required for vision processing)
  - CUDA Toolkit 12.2 or higher (or NVIDIA graphics card support)
  - NVIDIA JetPack SDK (required for Jetson platforms)
  - ZED SDK 4.1 or higher (for stereolabs cameras)
  - PyTorch 2.2.2 or higher (for machine learning tasks)
  - TensorFlow 2.15.0 or higher (for deep learning tasks)
  - Quill 6.1.2 or higher (for logging)
  - Google Test 1.15.2 (for testing)
  - Abseil 20230802.1 (for additional utilities)
  - GeographicLib 2.3 (for geospatial computations)

Now that your system is set up, you can proceed with the installation and build instructions provided in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

## üîß Build Modes

The Autonomy Software project includes various build modes to cater to different development, testing, and deployment needs.

### Simulation Mode

Simulation mode enables the software to be compiled with simulation-specific features. This mode is disabled by default and is currently configured for integration in the Webots Robot Simulator.

To enable **Simulation Mode**:

```bash
mkdir -p <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cd <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cmake -DBUILD_SIM_MODE=ON ..
make
./Autonomy_Software_Sim
```

### Code Coverage Mode

Code coverage mode compiles the software with flags that enable coverage reporting. This mode is disabled by default.

To enable **Code Coverage Mode**:

```bash
mkdir -p <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cd <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cmake -DBUILD_CODE_COVERAGE=ON ..
make
./Autonomy_Software
```

### Verbose Makefile Mode

Verbose mode provides detailed output during the build process, useful for debugging build issues. This mode is disabled by default.

To enable **Verbose Makefile Mode**:

```bash
mkdir -p <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cd <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cmake -DBUILD_VERBOSE_MODE=ON ..
make
```

### Install Mode

Install mode enables the packaging of the executable for installation. This mode is disabled by default.

To enable **Install Mode** and package the executable:

```bash
mkdir -p <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cd <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cmake -DBUILD_INSTALL_MODE=ON ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Tests Mode

Tests mode enables the compilation and execution of unit and integration tests. This mode is disabled by default.

To enable **Tests Mode** and run the tests:

```bash
mkdir -p <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cd <Autonomy Install Location>/build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS_MODE=ON ..
make
ctest
```

If tests are available, they will be compiled into separate executables for unit and integration tests. These tests can be run individually or using CTest.
