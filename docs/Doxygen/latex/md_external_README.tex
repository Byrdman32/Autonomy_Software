The {\bfseries{External}} directory is intended to store external dependencies, libraries, or third-\/party modules used in the rover project. This directory focuses on organizing and managing external code or resources that are required for the project\textquotesingle{}s functionality.\hypertarget{md_external_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Guidelines}\label{md_external_README_autotoc_md10}
The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the {\bfseries{External}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Store the external dependencies or libraries as separate directories within the {\bfseries{External}} directory.
\item Use the name of each external dependency or library as the directory name, or use a common convention for grouping related dependencies.
\item Include any necessary license files or documentation provided with the external dependencies.
\item Include a R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file in each subdirectory within the {\bfseries{External}} directory to provide information on the purpose and usage of the external dependency.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_external_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md_external_README_autotoc_md11}
Here are some common types of files or directories you might find within the {\bfseries{External}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Library A}}\+: Directory containing all the files and resources related to \char`\"{}\+Library A,\char`\"{} which is an external library used in the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Library B}}\+: Directory containing all the files and resources related to \char`\"{}\+Library B,\char`\"{} another external library utilized in the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Framework C}}\+: Directory containing the necessary files and resources for \char`\"{}\+Framework C,\char`\"{} a third-\/party framework used in the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Resources}}\+: Directory containing additional resources, such as datasets or configuration files, used by the external dependencies in the rover project.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Remember to update this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file whenever new external dependencies or libraries are added to the {\bfseries{External}} directory, providing a brief summary of each dependency\textquotesingle{}s purpose and functionality.

Ensure that the external dependencies are properly integrated and used within the rover project, adhering to any licensing or usage requirements.

Happy coding and leveraging external resources!
