\item Organize the documentation files based on their purpose or target audience, such as \char`\"{}\+User Guide,\char`\"{} \char`\"{}\+Developer Documentation,\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+A\+P\+I Reference.\char`\"{}
\item Include a R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file in the {\bfseries{Docs}} directory to provide an overview of the available documentation and instructions for accessing or navigating through it.
