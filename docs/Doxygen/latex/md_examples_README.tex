The {\bfseries{Examples}} directory is intended to store C++ files that provide example code snippets, demos, or sample implementations related to the rover project. This directory focuses on showcasing usage scenarios, best practices, or specific functionalities of the project.\hypertarget{md_examples_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Guidelines}\label{md_examples_README_autotoc_md7}
The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the {\bfseries{Examples}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Each C++ file should contain a self-\/contained example or demo related to a specific aspect or functionality of the rover project.
\item Use descriptive names for the files that reflect the purpose or functionality of the example.
\item Ensure that the files are properly documented with comments explaining the example, its purpose, input/output specifications, and any relevant details.
\item Include a R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file in the {\bfseries{Examples}} directory to provide an overview of the available examples, instructions for running them, and any additional information.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_examples_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md_examples_README_autotoc_md8}
Here are some common types of files you might find in the {\bfseries{Examples}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Basic functionality}}\+: Files that demonstrate the basic functionalities and usage patterns of the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Integration examples}}\+: Files that showcase the integration between different components or modules of the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Sensor usage}}\+: Files that provide examples of how to interact with sensors or external devices used in the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Algorithm implementations}}\+: Files that showcase the implementation of specific algorithms or techniques relevant to the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Case studies}}\+: Files that present real-\/world scenarios or case studies demonstrating the application of the rover project in practical situations.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Organize the example files in a way that makes it easy to navigate and explore different aspects of the rover project.

Remember to update this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file whenever new example files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each example\textquotesingle{}s purpose and functionality.

Use the examples as a reference and learning resource, helping developers understand and leverage the capabilities of the rover project effectively.

Happy coding and exploring the examples!
