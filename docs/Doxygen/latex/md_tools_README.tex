The {\bfseries{Tools}} directory is intended to store C++ files that provide utility scripts, development tools, or miscellaneous functionalities for the rover project. This directory focuses on supporting tasks related to development, debugging, or project management.\hypertarget{md_tools_README_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{Guidelines}\label{md_tools_README_autotoc_md37}
The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the {\bfseries{Tools}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Each C++ file should represent a specific tool, utility script, or functionality that supports the development or management of the rover project.
\item Use descriptive names for the files that reflect the purpose or functionality of the tool.
\item Ensure that the files are properly documented with comments explaining the usage, functionality, and any relevant details.
\item Include a R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file in any subdirectories within the {\bfseries{Tools}} directory to provide additional information if necessary.

Here are some common types of files you might find in the {\bfseries{Tools}} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Data generation or simulation}}\+: Files that generate synthetic or simulated data to aid in testing, debugging, or development of the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Deployment scripts}}\+: Files that automate the deployment process of the rover project, including tasks like compilation, packaging, or uploading to the target device.
\item {\bfseries{Configuration generators}}\+: Files that generate configuration files or setup scripts for various components or modules of the rover project.
\item {\bfseries{Data visualization tools}}\+: Files that provide tools or scripts to visualize data collected by the rover, enabling better analysis and understanding of the project\textquotesingle{}s performance.
\item {\bfseries{Project management scripts}}\+: Files that assist in project management tasks such as version control, code documentation generation, or task automation.
\item {\bfseries{Debugging utilities}}\+: Files that contain scripts or functions to assist in debugging and troubleshooting the rover project, including logging, error handling, or data inspection tools.
\item {\bfseries{Performance analysis tools}}\+: Files that analyze the performance and efficiency of the rover project, providing insights into areas for optimization or improvement.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Feel free to create subdirectories within the {\bfseries{Tools}} directory to further categorize the files based on the specific tools or functionalities they provide.

Remember to update this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME file whenever new tool files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file\textquotesingle{}s purpose and functionality.

Utilize the tools to streamline development, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance the overall efficiency of the rover project.

Happy coding and tooling!
